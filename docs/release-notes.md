## Release Notes

### 2.1.0

**Date:**

- Introduced the [PkiCredentialCollection](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredentialCollection.html) class that enables easier handling of several credentials.

- Also, [PkiCredentialCollectionConfiguration](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/PkiCredentialCollectionConfiguration.html) and [PkiCredentialCollectionConfigurationProperties](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties/PkiCredentialCollectionConfigurationProperties.html)
were added for configuration of a [PkiCredentialCollection](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredentialCollection.html). Also, the method `createCredentialCollection` was added to [PkiCredentialFactory](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/factory/PkiCredentialFactory.html).

- Using Spring Boot configuration, a [PkiCredentialCollection](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredentialCollection.html) bean can now be automatically created by providing configuration under the `credential.collection.*` property.

- The [PkiCredential.Metadata](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.Metadata.html) class has been extended with additional credential metadata properties:
    - `usage` - For assigning a credential usage, for example "signing" or "encryption".
    - `active-to` and `active-from` - For enabling "future signing credentials" and "previous encryption credentials".

- The [OpenSamlMetadataProperties](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/opensaml/OpenSamlMetadataProperties.html) class was extended with the `encryption-methods` property that enables assigning SAML metadata encryption methods to an encryption credential.

- Introduced the [KeyDescriptorTransformerFunction](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/credentials-support/apidoc/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/opensaml/OpenSamlMetadataProperties.html) that may be used to create a SAML metadata `md:KeyDescriptor` element.

### 2.0.7

**Date:** 2025-09-12

- Dependency updates.

- Fixed bug where `StoreCredentialConfigurationProperties.KeyConfigurationProperties` did not implement `hashcode`
  and `equals`, making it impossible to cache.

- We no longer assume that Spring Boot Actuator is on the classpath.

### 2.0.6

**Date:** 2025-05-08

- Dependency updates only.

### 2.0.5

**Date:** 2025-03-26

- When transforming from the old way of configuring credentials to the new we are a bit forgiving to avoid unnecessary
  confusion.

### 2.0.4

**Date:** 2025-02-26

- Extended
  the [PkiCredentialFactory](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/factory/PkiCredentialFactory.java)
  class so that it can be instantiated as a bean for easier use. This bean is also automatically provided by the Spring
  Boot starter.

### 2.0.3

**Date:** 2025-02-10

- Functionality to create serializable JWKs using the `JwkTransformerFunction#serializable` function was added.

### 2.0.2

**Date:** 2025-01-21

- The `PropertyToPublicKeyConverter` was added to the Spring Boot Starter autoconfiguration.

- Fixed bug that occurred if the same PKCS#11 provider were used for several keys.
  See https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/issues/74.

### 2.0.1

**Date:** 2024-12-07

- Moved Spring application events from the Spring Boot Starter to the Spring library to make them re-usable by other
  libraries.

### 2.0.0

**Date:** 2024-12-06

- A completely new base with support for Spring Boot, OpenSAML, Nimbus.
