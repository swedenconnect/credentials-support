## 1. Overview

The **credentials-support** library defines an uniform way of representing PKI credentials (private keys and X.509 certificates) by introducing the [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) interface.

The library supports both basic credentials stored on file, or in a key store (JKS, PKCS#12), as well as PKCS#11 credentials residing on a Hardware Security Module.

The **credentials-support-nimbus** library offers support for working with [Nimbus](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt) datatypes such as the [JWK](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt/examples/jwk-generation) class in conjunction with [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) objects.

The **credentials-support-opensaml** library offers an add-on for OpenSAML, where a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) object can be used to create an OpenSAML credential.

The **credentials-support-spring** library offers Spring add-ons consisting of converters, factories and configuration support.

The **credentials-support-spring-boot-starter** library is a Spring Boot starter that can be used for an easy and straight forward way of configuring credentials that are to be used in a Spring Boot application.

<a name="credential-types"></a>
## 2. Credential Types

The **credentials-support** library defines three classes implementing the [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) interface and a wrapper that takes a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) into an OpenSAML credential type.

<a name="basiccredential"></a>
### 2.1. BasicCredential

The [BasicCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/BasicCredential.java) class is a simple implementation of the [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) interface that is created by providing the private key and certificate (or just a public key). This class can for example be used when you have the key and certificate stored on file or in memory.

<a name="keystorecredential"></a>
### 2.2. KeyStoreCredential

The [KeyStoreCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/KeyStoreCredential.java) class is backed by a Java KeyStore and is initialized by providing a loaded KeyStore instance (see [KeyStore Builder and Factory](#keystore-builder-and-factory) below) and giving the entry alias and key password. 

This class also supports handling of PKCS#11 credentials. This requires using a security provider that supports creating a KeyStore based on an underlying PKCS#11 implementation (for example the SunPKCS11 provider).

:exclamation: For a PKCS#11 key store, the `alias` parameter is equal to the PKCS#11 `CKA_LABEL` attribute for the object holding the private key (and certificate), and the `password` parameter is the PIN needed to unlock the object.

**Note:** If you are using a security provider for PKCS#11 support that does not support exposing the HSM device as a Java KeyStore, you need to use the [Pkcs11Credential](#pkcs11credential) (see below).

<a name="pkcs11credential"></a>
### 2.3. Pkcs11Credential

As was described above, the [KeyStoreCredential](#keystorecredential) can be used for PKCS#11 credentials, but it is limited to those Java security providers that also offers a KeyStore abstraction of the PKCS#11 device entry. The [Pkcs11Credential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/pkcs11/Pkcs11Credential.java) is a class that does not make any assumptions on how the security provider in use handles its PKCS#11 entries. Instead it uses the [Pkcs11Configuration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/pkcs11/Pkcs11Configuration.java),
[Pkcs11PrivateKeyAccessor](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/pkcs11/Pkcs11PrivateKeyAccessor.java) and [Pkcs11CertificatesAccessor](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/pkcs11/Pkcs11CertificatesAccessor.java) interfaces.

The [Pkcs11Configuration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/pkcs11/Pkcs11Configuration.java) interface declares the method `getProvider()` that returns the Java Security Provider that should be used for the PKCS#11 credential, and the accessors provide access to the private key and certificates respectively.

So, for those that wishes to use the **credentials-support** library with a custom security provider there is an implementation task ahead...

> The **credentials-support** library also offers implementation of the above interfaces for providers that uses key stores for PKCS#11 (SunPKCS11 provider). However, if you are using the SunPKCS11 provider stick with the [KeyStoreCredential](#keystorecredential).

<a name="pkicredential-features"></a>
## 3. PkiCredential Features

The main use of a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) is to provide an abstraction and unified way of holding a private key and a certificate (or just a public key) for use in signing and decryption.

This section highlights some interesting features apart from getter-methods for keys and certificates.

<a name="credential-name"></a>
### 3.1. Credential Name

In an application where multiple credentials are used, we may want to have a way to name each credential (for logging and other purposes). Therefore, the `getName()` method exists, and the [AbstractPkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/AbstractPkiCredential.java) offers a way of assigning a custom name to a credential.

If no name is explicitly assigned, a name will be generated according to the following:

- For a [BasicCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/BasicCredential.java) the serial numver of the entity certificate will be used. If no certificate exists, the name will be chosen as \<public-key-type\>-\<uuid\>, for example, `RSA-0c6fbdce-b485-44a4-9000-93943626c675`.

- For a [KeyStoreCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/KeyStoreCredential.java) the following rules apply:
    - If the key store is a PKCS#11 key store, the name is `<provider name>-<alias>-<certificate serial number>`, for example `SunPKCS11-foo-rsa1-89716151`. Note that the provider name most usually is "base provider name"-"slot name".
    
    - For other key store types, the name is `<key type>-<alias>-<certificate serial number>`, for example `RSA-mykey-89716151`.
    
- For a [Pkcs11Credential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/pkcs11/Pkcs11Credential.java) the name is calculated as `<provider-name>-<alias>`.

:raised_hand: It is recommended that a custom name is assigned to each credential to get a good understanding of which credential is which when looking at the logs. Make sure to use unique names.

<a name="transformation-to-other-formats"></a>
### 3.2. Transformation to other Formats

The **credentials-support** libraries offer a uniform way of representing credentials via the [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) interface and also a smooth and efficient way of configuring those (see section [5](credential-bundles-and-configuration-support) below), but other frameworks and libraries have their way of representing credentials. So, we need a way to handle this. The solution is the `tranform` method:

```java
/**
 * Transforms the credential to another format, for example an JWK or a Java KeyPair.
 *
 * @param transformFunction the transform function
 * @param <T> the type of the new format
 * @return the new format
 */
default <T> T transform(@Nonnull final Function<PkiCredential, T> transformFunction) {
  return transformFunction.apply(this);
}
```

Thus, by implementing a `Function` that accepts a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) and returns the custom credential representation we can use the **credentials-support** library together with other frameworks.

See section [10](#nimbus-support), [Nimbus Support](#nimbus-support), for how to transform a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) into a [JWK](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.nimbusds/nimbus-jose-jwt/latest/com/nimbusds/jose/jwk/JWK.html) and section [11](#opensaml-support), [OpenSAML Support](#opensaml-support), for how to transform a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) into an OpenSAML [X509Credential](https://shibboleth.net/api/java-opensaml/5.1.3/org/opensaml/security/x509/X509Credential.html).


<a name="testing-and-reloading"></a>
### 3.3. Testing and Reloading

When using a HSM there is a possibility that the connection with the device is lost. The result is that the instantiated credential stops working. Therefore the **credentials-support** library offers ways to test and reload credentials. The credential types that support testing and reloading implements the [ReloadablePkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/ReloadablePkiCredential.java) interface.

An application that makes use of credentials that may fail, and may need to be reloaded, needs to set up a monitor that periodically tests that all monitored credentials are functional, and if not, tries to reload them. See section [6](#monitoring), [Monitoring](#monitoring), below.

For credentials implementing the [ReloadablePkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/ReloadablePkiCredential.java), the [DefaultCredentialTestFunction](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/monitoring/DefaultCredentialTestFunction.java) will be installed by default.

<a name="credential-metadata"></a>
### 3.4. Credential Metadata

Additional metadata may be associated with a credential. This is mainly useful when transforming to other formats, see section [3.2](#transformation-to-other-formats) above. The [PkiCredential.Metadata](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) interface is basically a map where metadata is stored.

The [AbstractPkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/AbstractPkiCredential.java) class will pre-populate the `issued-at` and `expires-at` based on the validity of a credential's entity certificate.

<a name="builders-and-factories"></a>
## 4. Builders and Factories

The libraries offer a number of builder and factory classes for building [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) and [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) objects.

<a name="keystore-builder-and-factories"></a>
### 4.1. KeyStore Builder and Factories

Setting up a Java [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) involves loading a file from disc and unlocking it. 

The [KeyStoreBuilder](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/factory/KeyStoreBuilder.java) class offers doing this using a standard builder pattern.

To load a Java KeyStore from file and to unlock it may then be done like:

```java
final KeyStore keyStore = KeyStoreBuilder.builder()
    .location("classpath:store.jks")
    .password("secret")
    .build();
```

> Note: The default resource loader will support strings with prefixes defined by Spring and [SmallRye](https://smallrye.io) (Qurkus style).

Example of how a PKCS#12 file is loaded.

```java
final KeyStore keyStore = KeyStoreBuilder.builder()
    .location("/opt/keys/mykeys.p12")
    .password("secret")
    .type("PKCS12")
    .build();
```

It is also possible to use the builder to load a PKCS#11 KeyStore:

```java
final KeyStore keyStore = KeyStoreBuilder.builder(customResourceLoader)
    .type("PKCS11")
    .provider("SunPKCS11")
    .pin("secret")
    .pkcs11ConfigurationFile("/opt/config/p11.conf")
    .build();
```

The example above illustrates how another resource loader is used. For Spring users, the [SpringConfigurationResourceLoader](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/config/SpringConfigurationResourceLoader.java) should be used.

Apart from the nice builder the class [KeyStoreFactory](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/factory/KeyStoreFactory.java) offers methods for loading a KeyStore. This class is mainly used internally when a [StoreConfiguration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/StoreConfiguration.java) object should be turned into a KeyStore. See section [5.2](#configuration-support) below.

See also section [8.1](#spring-factories), [Spring Factories](#spring-factories).

<a name="credential-factories"></a>
### 4.2. Credential Factories

Creating a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) instance is easiest done using the different constructors for [BasicCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/BasicCredential.java) or [KeyStoreCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/KeyStoreCredential.java), but the **credentials-support** also offers the [PkiCredentialFactory](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/factory/PkiCredentialFactory.java). This class is mainly intended to be used internally when loading configuration (see section [5.2](#configuration-support)) below.

See also section [8.1](#spring-factories), [Spring Factories](#spring-factories).

<a name="credential-bundles-and-configuration-support"></a>
## 5. Credential Bundles and Configuration Support

<a name="the-bundles-concept"></a>
### 5.1. The Bundles Concept

Spring Boot has introduced a feature called [SSL Bundles](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/ssl.html) where SSL/TLS credentials are configured in a separate place, and later referenced in different location where they are needed.

```yaml
spring:
  ssl:
    bundle:
      jks:
        mybundle:
          key:
            alias: "application"
          keystore:
            location: "classpath:application.p12"
            password: "secret"
            type: "PKCS12"
            
myapp:
  example:
    bundle: mybundle
```

The **credentials-support** library borrows/steals this concept and introduces "Credential Bundles", where [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) and [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) instances are configured under a bundle, and then referenced wherever they are needed.

Example:

```
credential:
  bundles:
    keystore:
      ks1:
        location: classpath:ks-1.jks
        password: secret
        type: JKS
    jks:
      cred1:
        store-reference: ks1
        name: "Credential One"
        key:
          alias: rsa1
          key-password: secret
      cred2:
        store-reference: ks1
        name: "Credential Two"
        key:
          alias: rsa2
          key-password: secret
    pem:
      cred3:
        certificates: file:/opt/creds/cred3.pem.crt
        private-key: file:/opt/creds/cred3.pkcs8.key
        name: "Credential Three"
        
myapp:
  example:
    credential: cred2
```

The package [se.swedenconnect.security.credential.bundle](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/tree/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle) contains support for implementing "Credential Bundles". It contains the following interfaces and classes:

- [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) - An interface for accessing registered credentials and keystores. 

- [CredentialBundleRegistry](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundleRegistry.java) - An interface for registering [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) and [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) instances in the credential bundle.

- [CredentialBundleRegistrar](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundleRegistrar.java) - A functional interface for registering stores and credentials at a [CredentialBundleRegistry](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundleRegistry.java).

- [DefaultCredentialBundleRegistry](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/DefaultCredentialBundleRegistry.java) - Default implementation of the [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) and [CredentialBundleRegistry](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundleRegistry.java) interfaces.

- [ConfigurationCredentialBundleRegistrar](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/ConfigurationCredentialBundleRegistrar.java) - An implementation of the [CredentialBundleRegistrar](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundleRegistrar.java) interface that sets up a [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) based on the a supplied [CredentialBundlesConfiguration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/CredentialBundlesConfiguration.java) (see section [5.2](#configuration-support) below).

The below example shows how a [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) is constructed.

```java
final CredentialBundlesConfiguration config = ...;
final DefaultCredentialBundleRegistry bundle = new DefaultCredentialBundleRegistry();

final ConfigurationCredentialBundleRegistrar registrar =
    new ConfigurationCredentialBundleRegistrar(config);
registrar.register(bundle);
// bundle is now populated with all stores and credentials available from the configuration object.
```

:raised_hand: When using the Spring Boot Starter, a fully populated [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) bean will be injected automatically based on the credentials configuration. See section [8.3](#the-spring-boot-starter-for-credentials-support), [The Spring Boot Starter for Credentials Support](#the-spring-boot-starter-for-credentials-support).

Once a [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) object has been set up, it can be queried for registered keystores and credentials.

### 5.2. Configuration Support

The package [se.swedenconnect.security.credential.config](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/tree/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config) contains interfaces for configuring [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) and [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) instances.

Each interface also has a corresponding implementation class under the [se.swedenconnect.security.credential.config.properties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/tree/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties) package.

The reason that interfaces are used is that we want to make it possible to use the [SmallRye Configuration Library](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-config/) to configure keystores and credentials. For Spring use, the corresponding concrete classes are used.

The following configuration interfaces and classes are available:

| Interface | Class | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [StoreConfiguration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/StoreConfiguration.java) | [StoreConfigurationProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties/StoreConfigurationProperties.java) | Configuration for creating a [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html).

One, and exactly one, of `bundle`, `jks` or `pem` must be supplied.<br />See [5.2.5](#pki-credential-configuration-properties). |
| [CredentialBundlesConfiguration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/CredentialBundlesConfiguration.java) | [CredentialBundlesConfigurationProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties/CredentialBundlesConfigurationProperties.java) | Configuration for bundles of credentials and keystores.<br />If both PEM and JKS (keystore) credentials are configured, the ID:s assigned must be unique for all credentials, i.e., the same ID can not be used for PEM and JKS.<br />See [5.2.6](#credential-bundles-configuration-properties). |

<a name="store-credential-configuration-properties"></a>
#### 5.2.4. StoreCredentialConfigurationProperties

Configuration for creating a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) backed by a [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html).

In addition to the [BaseCredentialConfigurationProperties](#base-credential-configuration-properties) the following properties are used to configure a JKS-based credential:

| Property | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `store` | Configuration for the [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) holding the key pair entry. Mutually exclusive with the `store-reference` property. | [StoreConfigurationProperties](#store-configuration-properties) |
| `store-reference` | A store reference. As an alternative to giving the key store configuration, a reference to a key store configuration may be given. This feature may be used when one key store holds several keys. Makes use of the [Bundles Concept](#the-bundles-concept). | String |
| `monitor` | Setting telling whether the credential should be configured for [monitoring](#monitoring). The default is `true` if the store used is a PKCS#11 store, and `false` otherwise. | Boolean |
| `key.alias` | The alias that identifies the key pair in the key store.<br />If the store is a PKCS#11 store, this setting corresponds to the PKCS#11 `CKA_LABEL` attribute for the object holding the private key on the device. | String |
| `key.key-password` | The password to unlock the key entry identified by the given alias. If not given, the store password will be used (in these cases, using a store reference will not function). | String |
| `key.certificates` | For some credentials where an underlying KeyStore is being used, an external certificate should be used. The most typical example would be a PKCS#11 key store where the certificate of the key pair resides outside the HSM device. This setting holds the location or content of the certificate or certificate chain in PEM format. | String |

Example:

```yml
credential:
  bundles:
    keystore:
      ks1:  
        ...
    jks:
      cred1:
        name: "Example credential #1"
        store-reference: ks1
        key:
          alias: test1
          key-password: secret
        monitor: true
        key-id: 123456
        issued-at: "2024-11-15T14:08:26Z"
        metadata:
          algorithm: RSA
          keyuse: sign
      cred2:
        name: "Example credential #2"
        store:
          location: file:/opt/keys/example.p12
          password: secret
          type: PKCS12
        key:
          alias: mykey
```

The above example illustrates how two JKS-credentials are configured. The first one refers to an already configured keystore and the other configures the store inline. Also note how metadata is configured for the first credential.

#### 5.2.5. PkiCredentialConfigurationProperties

The [PkiCredentialConfigurationProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties/PkiCredentialConfigurationProperties.java) is not used when setting up a credential using the [Bundles Concept](#the-bundles-concept). It is aimed to be used as the primary configuration object when a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) is to be configured directly in an application.

| Property | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bundle` | Reference to a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) accessible via the [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) bean. | String |
| `jks` | Configuration for a JKS (Java KeyStore) based credential. | [StoreCredentialConfigurationProperties](#store-credential-configuration-properties) |
| `pem` | Configuration for a PEM-based credential. | [PemCredentialConfigurationProperties](#pem-credential-configuration-properties) |

:exclamation: One, and exactly one, of `bundle`, `jks` or `pem` must be supplied.

Study the [TestConfigurationProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/softhsm/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/test/TestConfigurationProperties.java) and [TestConfiguration](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/softhsm/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/test/TestConfiguration.java) in the application example for how a [PkiCredentialConfigurationProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties/PkiCredentialConfigurationProperties.java) class can be used in an application's configuration to inject a credential (from a bundle or directly configured).

<a name="credential-bundles-configuration-properties"></a>
#### 5.2.6. CredentialBundlesConfigurationProperties

The [CredentialBundlesConfigurationProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/config/properties/CredentialBundlesConfigurationProperties.java) class is the main configuration class for setting up a [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) bean (see [5.1](#the-bundles-concept) above).

| Property | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `keystore` | Map of key store ID:s and key store configurations. | Map where keys are Strings (ID:s) and the values are [StoreConfigurationProperties](#store-configuration-properties). |
| `pem` | Map of credential ID:s and PEM based credential configurations. | Map where keys are Strings (ID:s) and the values are [PemCredentialConfigurationProperties](#pem-credential-configuration-properties). |
| `jks` | Map of credential ID:s and key store based credential configurations. | Map where keys are Strings (ID:s) and the values are [StoreCredentialConfigurationProperties](#store-credential-configuration-properties). |
| `monitoring.enabled` | Spring Boot only.<br />Whether credential monitoring is enabled. If enabled, a [CredentialMonitorBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/monitoring/CredentialMonitorBean.java) is set up to monitor all credentials (that are configured for monitoring). | Boolean |
| `monitoring.test-interval` | Spring Boot only.<br />The interval between tests of credentials. The default is 10 minutes. | [Duration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html) |
| `monitoring.health-endpoint-enabled` | Spring Boot only.<br />Whether a HealthEndpoint for monitoring should be set up. See section [8.3.1](#credential-monitoring-health-endpoint), [Credential Monitoring Health Endpoint](#credential-monitoring-health-endpoint). | Boolean |

:exclamation: If both PEM and JKS (keystore) credentials are configured, the ID:s assigned must be unique for all credentials, i.e., the same ID can not be used for PEM and JKS.

<a name="monitoring"></a>
## 6. Monitoring

When using a HSM there is a possibility that the connection with the device is lost. The result is that the instantiated credential stops working. Therefore the **credentials-support** library offers ways to test and reload credentials. The credential types that support testing and reloading implements the [ReloadablePkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/ReloadablePkiCredential.java) interface.

An application that makes use of credentials that may fail, and may need to be reloaded, needs to set up a monitor that periodically tests that all monitored credentials are functional, and if not, tries to reload them.

By implementing the [CredentialMonitorBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/monitoring/CredentialMonitorBean.java) interface and schedule it to run periodically, one or more credentials can be monitored.

The [DefaultCredentialMonitorBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/monitoring/DefaultCredentialMonitorBean.java) is the default implementation of this interface. It can be configured with a number of callbacks that can be used for raising alarms or produce audit logs.

> The [The Spring Boot Starter for Credentials Support](#the-spring-boot-starter-for-credentials-support) creates a monitor bean automatically based on the credential configuration.

## 7. Credential Containers for Managing Keys

This library provides support for setting up a credential container for generating, storing and managing public and private key pairs.

The primary use case for the credential container is when key pairs for user accounts are generated and maintained by an application and these keys are generated and stored in a HSM slot.  A typical such usage is when a signing service needs to generate a signing key for a document signer (user), and where this key is used to sign a document and then permanently deleted/destroyed without ever leaving the HSM.

Such procedure is necessary for the highest level of confidence that the signing key is kept under so called "sole-control" in accordance with the eIDAS regulation, which ensures that the key can never be copied or used by any other process or person to sign any other document under another identity.

Even though the HSM option is the primary use case, the credential container also supports software based or in-memory key storage.

<a name="creating-a-credential-container"></a>
### 7.1. Creating a Credential Container

A credential container is created according to the following examples:

<a name="hsm-based-credential-container"></a>
#### 7.1.1. HSM-based Credential Containers

A credential container backed up by a HSM via the PKCS#11 interface is implemented by the [HsmPkiCredentialContainer](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/container/HsmPkiCredentialContainer.java) class.

```java
final PkiCredentialContainer credentialContainer = new HsmPkiCredentialContainer(provider, hsmSlotPin);
```

The `provider` parameter is the security provider that implements the HSM slot‚ and the `hsmSlotPin` is the PIN code for accessing the HSM slot.

Instead of supplying a provider for the HSM slot as input, you may instead provide a `Pkcs11Configuration` object:

```java
final Pkcs11Configuration pkcs11Configuration = ...
final PkiCredentialContainer credentialContainer =
    new HsmPkiCredentialContainer(pkcs11Configuration, hsmSlotPin);
```

In most cases, the connection to the HSM-device is configured using a PKCS#11 configuration file, and
a `HsmPkiCredentialContainer` may be initialized by giving the full path to such a file.

```java
final String p11ConfigFile = "/opt/config/p11/hsm.cfg";
final PkiCredentialContainer credentialContainer = 
    new HsmPkiCredentialContainer(p11ConfigFile, hsmSlotPin);
```

<a name="in-memory-keystore-based-credential-container"></a>
#### 7.1.2. In-memory KeyStore-based Credential Container

The above example uses a Java [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) to maintain the keys/credentials in the HSM, but it is also possible to use a container that uses a [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) that resides in memory. The [SoftPkiCredentialContainer](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/container/SoftPkiCredentialContainer.java) class is mainly intended to mimic the behaviour of `HsmPkiCredentialContainer` and may be used in tests and simulations. See [7.1.3](#in-memory-based-credential-container) below for an in-memory credential container that does not go the detour via KeyStore-usage.

An in-memory KeyStore-based credential container is created as follows:

```java
final PkiCredentialContainer credentialContainer = new SoftPkiCredentialContainer(provider);
```

The `provider` parameter is either a Java Security Provider, or the name of the security provider. This provider is used to create the key store used to store keys as well as the provider used to generate keys.

<a name="in-memory-credential-container"></a>
#### 7.1.3. In-memory Credential Container

In order to use an in-memory based credential container create an instance of [InMemoryPkiCredentialContainer](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/container/InMemoryPkiCredentialContainer.java) as follows:

```java
final InMemoryPkiCredentialContainer credentialsContainer = new InMemoryPkiCredentialContainer(provider);
```

The `provider` parameter is either a Java Security Provider, or the name of the security provider. This provider is used to create the key store used to store keys as well as the provider used to generate
keys.

<a name="using-the-credential-container"></a>
### 7.2. Using the Credential Container

Keys are generated in the credential container by calling the method `generateCredential(keyType)`, 
where `keyType` is a string representing an algorithm and key type, see [KeyGenType](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/container/keytype/KeyGenType.java).

**Example:** Generating a Nist P-256 EC key pair:

```
final String alias = credentialContainer.generateCredential(KeyGenType.EC_P256);
```

The returned alias is the handle used to obtain a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) object for the newly generated key pair.

```
final PkiCredential credential = credentialContainer.getCredential(alias);
```

**Destroying credentials after use**

The [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) objects returned from the credential container have extended capabilities to ensure that the private key is destroyed when calling the `destroy()` method of the `PkiCredential` object.

In order to ensure that private keys are properly removed after usage, implementations should:

1. Create keys with as short validity time as possible.<sup>*</sup>
2. On all restarts and on suitable occasions, call the `cleanup()` method to ensure that old keys are properly deleted.<sup>**</sup>
3. Always call the `destroy()` method immediately after its last intended use.

> \[\*\]: The validity time of a key pair (credential) is 15 minutes by default. It can be changed
using the `setKeyValidity` method on the container.

> \[\*\*\]: It is also wise to schedule a task that periodically invokes the `cleanup()` method of the container in use. By doing so we ensure that generated keys are not left too long in the container (expired credentials will be purged).

## 8. Spring Support

By including the **credentials-support-spring** artifact, the Credential Support is extended with Spring features.

<a name="spring-factories"></a>
### 8.1. Spring Factories

The **credentials-support-spring**, offers the [se.swedenconnect.security.credential.spring.factory.PkiCredentialFactoryBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/factory/PkiCredentialFactoryBean.java). This is a Spring-style factory that accepts different credential configuration objects (see [5.2](#configuration-support)).

> The [se.swedenconnect.security.credential.factory.PkiCredentialFactoryBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/factory/PkiCredentialFactoryBean.java) previously used in earlier versions of the **credentials-support** library has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

The library also offers the following factory beans:

- [KeyStoreFactoryBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/factory/KeyStoreFactoryBean.java) - for creating [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) instances using the Spring factory bean concept. However, it is recommended to use the [Bundles Concept(#the-bundles-concept) when creating key stores.

- [X509CertificateFactoryBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/feature/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/factory/X509CertificateFactoryBean.java) - for creating [X509Certificate](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/X509Certificate.html) instances given a [Resource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/Resource.html).

<a name="spring-converters"></a>
### 8.2. Spring Converters

A Spring [Converter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html) is an interface for type conversion. This feature is typically useful when using an application properties or YAML-file and we want to convert from Strings in the property file to certain types. 

The following converters are available:

- [PropertyToPrivateKeyConverter](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/converters/PropertyToPrivateKeyConverter.java) - A [Converter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html) that gets a property value (e.g., `classpath:signing.key`) and instantiates a `PrivateKey` object.<br /><br /> Note: The converter only handles non-encrypted private keys in DER, PEM, and PKCS#8 formats.

- [PropertyToPublicKeyConverter](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/converters/PropertyToPublicKeyConverter.java) - A [Converter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html) that gets a property value (e.g., `classpath:trust.key`) and instantiates a `PublicKey` object.

- [PropertyToX509CertificateConverter](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/converters/PropertyToX509CertificateConverter.java) - A [Converter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html) that gets a property value (e.g., `classpath:cert.crt`) and instantiates an `X509Certificate` object. The converter also handles "inlined" PEM certificates.

- [PkiCredentialReferenceConverter](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/converters/PkiCredentialReferenceConverter.java) - A [Converter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html) that accepts a string that is a reference to a registered [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) and uses the
system [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) bean to create a resolvable [PkiCredentialReference](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/config/PkiCredentialReference.java).

- [KeyStoreReferenceConverter](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/converters/KeyStoreReferenceConverter.java) - A [Converter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html) that accepts a string that is a reference to a registered [KeyStore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/KeyStore.html) and uses the system [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) bean to create a resolvable [KeyStoreReference](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/config/KeyStoreReference.java).

If the Spring Boot starter is used, these converters will be automatically installed. Otherwise, they have to be "manually" configured, see <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/convert.html>.


<a name="the-spring-boot-starter-for-credentials-support"></a>
### 8.3. The Spring Boot Starter for Credentials Support

The **credentials-support-spring-boot-starter** gives a number of useful features:

- Injection of a fully populated [CredentialBundles](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/bundle/CredentialBundles.java) bean. This bean is populated based on the configuration described in section [5](#credential-bundles-and-configuration-support), [Credential Bundles and Configuration Support](#credential-bundles-and-configuration-support).

- Automatic registration of the converters documented in section [8.2](#spring-converters), [Spring Converters](#spring-converters).

- The creation and injection of a scheduled [CredentialMonitorBean](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/monitoring/CredentialMonitorBean.java) bean.

- As part of the monitoring of credentials a number of application events are published. These events may be used for alarms or audit logging. The events are:

    - [SuccessfulCredentialTestEvent](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/monitoring/events/SuccessfulCredentialTestEvent.java) - An event that is signalled when a credential has been tested and the test was successful.
    
    - [FailedCredentialTestEvent](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/monitoring/events/FailedCredentialTestEvent.java) - An event that is signalled when a credential has been tested and the test failed.
    
    - [SuccessfulCredentialReloadEvent](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/monitoring/events/SuccessfulCredentialReloadEvent.java) - An event that is signalled when a credential has been reloaded successfully.
    
    - [FailedCredentialReloadEvent](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/monitoring/events/FailedCredentialReloadEvent.java) - An event that is signalled when a credential has been reloaded with an error. This means that the credential no longer is functional.
    
- If configured (`credential.bundle.monitoring.health-endpoint-enabled` is set), an actuator health endpoint for credential monitoring is configured and made active. See below.

<a name="credential-monitoring-health-endpoint"></a>
#### 8.3.1. Credential Monitoring Health Endpoint

If the property `credential.bundle.monitoring.health-endpoint-enabled` is set, the actuator health endpoint [CredentialMonitorHealthIndicator](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/spring/credentials-support-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/spring/actuator/CredentialMonitorHealthIndicator.java) is created and registered under the name `credential-monitor`.

If everything is looking good (no failed tests of reloads), an output like the following will be returned:

```json
{
  "status" : "UP",
  "details" : {
    "credentials" : [ 
      {
        "credential-name" : "Signing",
        "test-result" : "success"
      }, 
      {
         "credential-name" : "Encryption",
        "test-result" : "success"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `credential-name` holds the configured name for the credential (see section [3.1](#credential-name)).

An error may look like:

```json
{
  "status" : "DOWN",
  "details" : {
    "credentials" : [ 
      {
        "credential-name" : "Signing",
        "test-result" : "success"
      }, 
      {
        "credential-name" : "Encryption",
        "test-result" : "failure",
        "test-error" : "Failed to access the private key",
        "test-exception" : "java.lang.SecurityException",
        "reload-result" : "failure",
        "reload-error" : "No contact with PKCS#11 device",
        "reload-exception" : "java.security.KeyStoreException"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In the above example it seems like both testing and reloading of the credential named "Encryption" has failed. 

The health endpoint delivers a details-map, where the `credentials` key holds a list of objects (one for each monitored credential). These objects have the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `credential-name` | The name of the credential that was tested (and possible reloaded). |
| `test-result` | The result of a test. May be `success` or `failure`. |
| `test-error` | If the `test-result` is `failure`, this field holds a string describing the test error. |
| `test-exception` | If the `test-result` is `failure`, this field holds the class name for the exception that occurred during testing. |
| `reload-result` | If a test failed, the credential is reloaded. This field holds the result of the reloading. May be `success` or `failure`. |
| `reload-error` | If the `reload-result` is `failure`, this field holds a string describing the reload error. |
| `reload-exception` | If the `reload-result` is `failure`, this field holds the class name for the exception that occurred during reloading. |

<a name="opensaml-support"></a>
## 9. OpenSAML Support

The library **credentials-support-opensaml** contains the [OpenSamlCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/opensaml/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/opensaml/OpenSamlCredential.java) class which is a class that wraps a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) as an OpenSAML [X509Credential](https://shibboleth.net/api/java-opensaml/5.0.0/org/opensaml/security/x509/X509Credential.html). This enables us to use the configuration support of the **credentials-support** library and use our credentials in an OpenSAML context.

The **credentials-support-opensaml** library also defines the [OpenSamlCredentialTransformerFunction](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/opensaml/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/opensaml/OpenSamlCredentialTransformerFunction.java), which can be supplied to the `transform` method of an existing [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) and create an [OpenSamlCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/opensaml/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/opensaml/OpenSamlCredential.java) instance.  

<a name="nimbus-support"></a>
## 10. Nimbus Support

The **credentials-support-nimbus** library offers support for working with [Nimbus](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt) datatypes such as the [JWK](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt/examples/jwk-generation) class in conjunction with [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) objects.

It introduces the [JwkTransformerFunction](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/nimbus/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/nimbus/JwkTransformerFunction.java) for transforming a [PkiCredential](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/credentials-support/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/PkiCredential.java) into a [JWK](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.nimbusds/nimbus-jose-jwt/latest/com/nimbusds/jose/jwk/JWK.html) instance.

Also check the [JwkMetadataProperties](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/nimbus/src/main/java/se/swedenconnect/security/credential/nimbus/JwkMetadataProperties.java) for definitions of metadata keys useful for an JWK.

> Note: This library will be extended with more useful features in future versions.

<a name="pkcs11-specifics"></a>
## 11. PKCS#11 Specifics

<a name="using-softhsm-to-test-pkcs11-credentials"></a>
### 11.1. Using SoftHSM to Test PKCS#11 Credentials

[SoftHSM](https://wiki.opendnssec.org/display/SoftHSMDOCS) is a great way to test your PKCS#11 credentials without an actual HSM. The **credentials-support** library contains a simple Spring Boot app that illustrates how to set up SoftHSM and how to configure your PKCS#11 devices, see the [softhsm](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/tree/main/softhsm) directory for details.

Once you have an application that is setup to use credentials from an HSM, this library also includes a set of scripts that extends a docker image with SoftHSM support. These scripts and their usage is described in [hsm-support-scripts/soft-hsm-deployment/README.md](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/hsm-support-scripts/soft-hsm-deployment/README.md).

<a name="key-generation-scripts"></a>
### 11.2. Key Generation Scripts

In order to support generation and installing of keys and key certificates in any HSM device as part of setting up a production environment, this repository also provides some supporting key generation scripts:

- A PKCS11 key generation script (p11-keygen.sh) used to generate keys and install certificates in a HSM slot.
- A corresponding soft key generation script that will create key stores (JKS and PKCS12) to support test environment setup.

For further information consult the information at [hsm-support-scripts/key-generation/README.md](https://github.com/swedenconnect/credentials-support/blob/main/hsm-support-scripts/key-generation/README.md)
