/**
 * The default implementation of the {@link CredentialMonitorBean} interface.
 * <p>
 * The bean can be configured to monitor one, or several, credentials. Note that the credentials being tested must have
 * a test function installed ({@link KeyPairCredential#getTestFunction()} must not be {@code null}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The reason for performing monitoring of credentials is to detect, and possibly fix, the cases where a credential
 * becomes non-functional. This may typically happen if a credential that resides on a hardware device is used. The
 * connection to the device may get lost, and may be fixed by a re-connect. Those types of credentials takes care of
 * their own reloading by implementing {@link KeyPairCredential#reload()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since testing a credential, especially those residing on hardware devices, may be a relatively costly operation, the
 * monitor bean also supports configuring "additional credentials for reload" ({@link #setAdditionalForReload(List)}).
 * The use case here is that one credential is configured to be monitored (tested), and if this test fails, we try to
 * reload this credential, but also the "additional credentials for reload". This case may be used if we know that we
 * have a set of credentials that all reside on the same device, and if one is non-functional the others will not work
 * either (bacause of a connection failure). In this case we save computing power and keep testing only one credential,
 * and if that one fails, reloads not only the failing credential but the other ones as well.
 * </p>
