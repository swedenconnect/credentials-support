/**
 * This interface defines the function of a multi credential container with keys that are contained and managed inside
 * the container for its entire lifetime.
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary use-case for this credential container is to be used with a HSM for generating ephemeral key credentials
 * that are generated inside the HSM and used for a short period of time and then deleted without ever leaving the HSM.
 * A typical use-case for this scenario is the generation and destruction of signing keys in a signature service where
 * the signing key is used only once and then destroyed in order to guarantee that the key can never be used in any
 * other process for any other purpose.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * While the primary use-case for this credential container is for use with HSM, it may also be implemented using a
 * software based key store for implementations with less demands for security or for the purpose of testing and
 * prototyping.
 * </p>
