/**
 * Extends a  {@link ExternalChainCredential} which implements {@link PkiCredential} and provides a credential
 * that is intended to be used to be associated with a temporary key generated on an HSM device.
 *
 * <p>
 *   This implementation of PKI credential is not intended to be implemented as a bean, but is rather provided by
 *   a HSM key generation process that includes 2 separate steps:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The credential is first created inside a hsm slot</li>
 * <li>This credential key is used to generate a first self issued certificate sotred in the HSM</li>
 * <li>The public key is sent to a CA for certification and the resulting chain is imported in to the credential but not to the HSM slot</li>
 * <li>After usage, the credential provides the necessary functions to permanently delete the key from the HSM</li>
 * </ul>
